## Plan 5: n8n Webhook Triggers

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Low

Add webhook trigger nodes to Scrape Listings, Scrape Detail Pages, and Cleanup Artifacts for programmatic triggering.

---

## Plan 14: Codebase Audit Bug Fixes

**Status:** Mostly complete (14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.6, 14.8 done). Remaining items are low-risk defensive fixes.

**14.1 — VIN case normalization** — `stg_detail_observations` passes raw VIN (only 1 lowercase VIN found)
**14.5 — Price events dedup** — `UNION ALL` with no dedup (only 1 actual duplicate found)
**14.9 — Browser singleton lock** — no `threading.Lock()` on `get_browser()` (low risk in practice)
**14.11 — Chrome fingerprint env var** — hardcoded `chrome131` (working fine currently)
**14.12 — max_safety_pages validator** — no bounds check (low risk)

## Remaining Priority Order

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | **25.4** — Replace correlated subquery in staleness | Wait 24-48h for customer_id to populate |
| 2 | **33** — Add error info to runs table | Better run failure visibility |
| 3 | **34** — Fix artifact_count subquery in Job Poller | Prevents overcounting across runs |
| 4 | **29** — n8n API + trigger button | Programmatic workflow control |
| 5 | **30** — More detailed run info in dashboard | Execution list, duration, processing stats |
| 6 | **14.1** — VIN case normalization | Defensive — only 1 affected VIN |
| 7 | **14.5** — Price events dedup | Defensive — only 1 duplicate found |
| 8 | **14.9 / 14.11 / 14.12** — Minor defensive fixes | Low risk |
| 9 | **5** — Webhook triggers | Folded into Plan 29 |
| 10 | **35** — dbt schema audit | Missing staging layers + ops consolidation |

## Plan 25: Bridge Dealer ID Systems

**Status:** 25.1/25.2/25.3 done (2026-03-20). 25.4 waiting for data population (24-48h).
**Priority:** High

cars.com uses two different dealer identifiers:
- **UUID** (`150b427b-c147-5a18-a733-cf5aa95519d0`) — in SRP JSON, stored in `srp_observations.seller_customer_id`
- **Numeric** (`735`) — in detail page HTML, already parsed by `parse_detail_page.py` and written to `dealers.customer_id`, but never stored in `detail_observations`


**25.4 — Replace correlated subquery in `ops_vehicle_staleness.sql`** *(defer 24-48h after 25.2 ships)*

Once `customer_id` has been populating for at least one full scrape cycle, the expensive correlated NOT EXISTS subquery for `dealer_unenriched` can be replaced with a simple null check.

Add `customer_id` to the `base` CTE SELECT from `mart_vehicle_snapshot`, then:
```sql
-- Replace correlated NOT EXISTS with:
(b.customer_id IS NULL) AS dealer_unenriched
```

⚠️ Do NOT deploy this until after 25.2 has been running for 24-48h. If deployed while `customer_id` is still NULL for all historical rows, every VIN will be flagged `dealer_unenriched = true` and the staleness system will schedule a full re-scrape of everything.

---

**Execution order:** DB migration → n8n workflow → dbt models (25.2+25.3 together) → wait 24-48h → 25.4

## Plan 29: Set up n8n API

- Set up the n8n API so we can interact with it programatically.
- Fold in Plan 5 to this.
- Add button to trigger detail scrape from from dashboard.

## Plan 30: More detailed Run info in Dashboard

- Increase the quality of information we're getting about running n8n processes in Dashboard.
- List of ongoing executions
- Lengh of time
- Information about results processing and detail parsing

## Plan 33: Add error info to runs table
- runs table has no `error_count` or `last_error` column
- When a run fails, there's no record of why (only in scrape_jobs)
- Add columns and update Job Poller's Mark Run Done to populate them

## Plan 34: Fix artifact_count subquery in Job Poller
- `Update scrape_jobs` counts artifacts matching `search_key + search_scope` but doesn't filter by `run_id`
- Could overcount if same search_key+scope runs overlap
- Add `AND run_id = scrape_jobs.run_id` to the subquery

## Plan 35: dbt Schema Audit — staging gaps + ops consolidation

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Low

Audit found two issues with the current dbt model organization:

### 35.1 — Missing staging layers

4 raw tables are accessed directly by intermediate/mart models without a staging layer:

| Raw Table | Direct Consumers (bypassing staging) |
|---|---|
| `raw_artifacts` | `int_listing_days_on_market`, `int_model_price_benchmarks`, `int_price_percentiles_by_vin`, `int_srp_vehicle_attributes`, `mart_deal_scores` |
| `dealers` | `int_dealer_inventory`, `mart_deal_scores` |
| `detail_observations` | `int_latest_dealer_name_by_vin` |
| `srp_observations` | `ops_vehicle_staleness` |

**Decision needed:** Should we add `stg_raw_artifacts`, `stg_dealers`? Or are these tables clean enough to access directly? `raw_artifacts` is the worst offender (5 consumers). `dealers` is small and simple. The `detail_observations` and `srp_observations` direct access in `int_latest_dealer_name_by_vin` and `ops_vehicle_staleness` should use the existing staging models.

### 35.2 — Ops schema: deprecate or expand?

Currently `ops/` contains only `ops_vehicle_staleness`. Two options:

**Option A — Deprecate ops, move to intermediate:**
`ops_vehicle_staleness` is consumed only by the n8n Get Batch query (not by other dbt models). It reads from `mart_vehicle_snapshot` and raw sources. Move it to `intermediate/` as `int_vehicle_staleness` for consistency.

**Option B — Expand ops as the "operational queries" schema:**
Move operational intermediate models that serve n8n/pipeline (not analytics) into `ops/`:
- `int_dealer_inventory` → `ops_dealer_inventory` (used by batch query logic)
- `int_latest_dealer_name_by_vin` → `ops_latest_dealer_name` (used for display only)
- Keep `ops_vehicle_staleness` where it is

**Recommendation:** Option A is simpler. The ops schema adds cognitive overhead for one model. If we later have 3+ operational models, revisit Option B.

---

## Plan 36: Automate n8n workflow setup

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium

Currently, deploying workflow changes requires manually importing JSON files via the n8n UI. This is error-prone and blocks CI/CD.

**Options to investigate:**

1. **n8n CLI import** — `n8n import:workflow --input=file.json` can be run inside the container. Could script a startup entrypoint that imports all JSON files from a mounted directory on container creation.

2. **n8n REST API** — Enable the n8n API (`N8N_PUBLIC_API_ENABLED=true` env var), then use `PUT /workflows/{id}` to update workflows programmatically. Pairs with Plan 29. Would need to store workflow IDs somewhere stable.

3. **Volume-mount the n8n DB** — n8n uses SQLite by default. Could snapshot and restore the entire n8n state, but this is brittle across n8n version upgrades.

4. **Startup script** — Add a `docker-entrypoint` wrapper that runs `n8n import:workflow --separate --input=/workflows/` before starting n8n. Mount `n8n/workflows/` into the container. This would auto-import on every container rebuild.

**Goal:** After editing a workflow JSON in git, `docker compose up -d n8n` should pick up the change without manual UI work. Credential wiring may still need a one-time manual step.

## Plan 37: Use unmapped carousel hints to trigger detail scrapes

**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** Medium

Right now we don't do anything with our unmapped carousel hints. We should do a couple things.

1. Make sure that if we ever do see a vehicle, the carousel hints from the past are correctly tied to it and incorporated in its price history
2. Trigger Detail scrapes of those vehicles, checking that the makes/models are in our search configs before inserting the rows
   - We should see what info we can get from the carousel cards related to make/model, maybe we can pre-emptively exclude hints that fall outside our search params

Implementing this will reduce reliance on Search Scrapes to discover new VINS, giving us another way to increase coverage.

### Done

- **Pool 3 in batch query** — `Scrape Detail Pages` workflow pulls unmapped carousel hints as a third pool, limited to the count of pools 1+2
- **`int_carousel_price_events_unmapped`** — dbt model surfaces carousel hints not yet mapped to a VIN
- **`int_carousel_price_events_mapped`** — dbt model feeds mapped carousel hints into `int_price_events` as Tier-2 events
- **Fixed batch query URL** — was `vehicle_data/{id}`, corrected to `vehicledetail/{id}/`
- **Fixed VIN fallback** — Write Detail Observations now validates `search_key` is 17-char alphanumeric before using as VIN fallback (prevents UUIDs from being stored as VINs)
- **Expanded `int_listing_to_vin`** — now includes detail observations as a VIN source, so carousel hints become mapped after successful scrape
- **Excluded already-scraped hints** — `int_carousel_price_events_unmapped` excludes listing_ids already in `detail_observations` to prevent infinite re-scraping

- **Make filtering** — `int_carousel_price_events_unmapped` extracts make from `body` text (`split_part(body, ' ', 3)`) and inner-joins against `search_configs.params->'makes'`, excluding out-of-scope vehicles (e.g., Volvo, Jeep)
- **Dashboard metrics** — Carousel Hint Discovery section in Pipeline Health tab showing: unique hints, in-scope, mapped-to-VIN, scraped, and queued counts

## Future Ideas (Unprioritized)

- **Price alert notifications** — email/SMS when a VIN drops below a threshold
- **Dealer reputation scoring** — aggregate rating, inventory size, price competitiveness
- **Geographic heatmaps** — map view of inventory density and pricing by region
- **VIN decode enrichment** — NHTSA VIN decoder for specs not on Cars.com (engine, transmission, packages)
- **Historical deal analysis** — track which deal-scored VINs actually sold (went unlisted) and at what price

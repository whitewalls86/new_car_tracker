# Cartracker — Plans & Roadmap

---

## Completed

| Plan | Description | Date |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | **Detail page scraper** — curl_cffi bypasses Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting | 2026-03-16 |
| 1 | **Search sort-order rotation** — 4-day rotation (list_price, listed_at_desc, best_deal, best_match_desc) | 2026-03-16 |
| 2 | **Dealer-grouped detail refresh** — batch query partitions by `seller_customer_id` | 2026-03-16 |
| 3 | **Params schema cleanup** — removed `page_size`/`max_pages`, added `scopes` array | 2026-03-16 |
| 4 | **Artifact cleanup pipeline** — retention rules + daily n8n workflow | 2026-01 |
| 7 | **dbt materialized view migration** — `int_listing_current_state` + `int_vin_current_state` as dbt tables | 2026-03-16 |
| 8 | **403 artifact poisoning fix** — 1M+ Cloudflare block pages re-marked, staleness view unblocked | 2026-03-16 |
| 9 | **Analytics Dashboard** — 4-section Streamlit dashboard, mobile tabs, dealer names, refresh button, pipeline health | 2026-03-17 |
| 10 | **Pipeline durability** — stale run termination, stuck artifact reset, `pipeline_errors` table, Error Handler workflow | 2026-03-16 |
| 11 | **Search config admin UI** — FastAPI + Jinja2 at `/admin`, Pydantic models, CRUD for `search_configs` | 2026-03-16 |
| 12 | **Dealer Table** — `dealers` table, 7,259 backfilled, parsed from detail pages, included in mart models | 2026-03-17 |
| 13 | **dbt incremental optimization** — `int_latest_price_by_vin` + `int_latest_tier1_observation_by_vin` as incremental. `mart_vehicle_snapshot` dropped from 80s+ to <1s | 2026-03-16 |
| 14.4 | **Staleness window dbt var** — extracted `now() - interval '3 days'` to `var("staleness_window_days")` | 2026-03-17 |
| 14.6 | **Percentile default** — `mart_deal_scores` uses 0.75 default for missing benchmarks | 2026-03-17 |
| 14.8 | **Admin soft-delete** — delete now disables + renames key instead of hard `DELETE` | 2026-03-17 |
| 15 | **Dashboard polish + Telegram alerts** — Telegram Error Handler, active run indicator, dealer names, refresh button, mobile tabs | 2026-03-17 |
| 16.1 | **Twice-daily SRP** — second daily schedule, burns through sort rotation in 2 days | 2026-03-17 |
| 16.2 | **Exclude unlisted VINs from staleness view** — confirmed already implemented (`WHERE listing_state IS DISTINCT FROM 'unlisted'`) | 2026-03-17 |
| 21 | **Staleness discrepancy** — resolved; both dashboard widgets draw from same 47,551 active VINs | 2026-03-17 |
| 6 | **Async SRP scraping** — ThreadPoolExecutor(12), Job Poller, `scrape_jobs` table, jitter delays. Scrape time ~3hr → ~20min | 2026-03-17 |
| 6.1 | **Orphan job recovery** — `Expire Orphaned Jobs` node in Job Poller marks stuck jobs failed after 30min | 2026-03-17 |
| 6.2 | **Failed API job propagation** — `/completed` endpoint now includes failed jobs so Poller clears them | 2026-03-17 |
| 19 | **Detail scrape waits for search scrape** — IF node loop at start of Scrape Detail Pages, waits 3 min and retries if any scrape is running | 2026-03-17 |
| 18 | **Active scrape progress in dashboard** — `progress_count`/`total_count` on `runs`, 10% milestone UPDATEs in loop, dashboard shows "X / Y scraped (Z%)" | 2026-03-17 |
| 14.2 | **Duplicate ops models** — deleted both `ops_listing_trace` and `ops_vin_latest_artifact` (identical, unused) | 2026-03-17 |
| 22 | **dbt model cleanup** — audited all 19 models; deleted 3 orphans (`int_carousel_hints_unmapped`, `int_listing_current_state`, `int_vin_current_state`) + schemas. 16 active models all have downstream consumers. | 2026-03-17 |
| 17 | **Update README** — full rewrite: architecture diagram, all 6 services, 7 workflows, 16 dbt models, data model, refresh strategy, setup steps, project structure | 2026-03-17 |
| 23 | **Fresh install support** — updated `schema_new.sql` (pg_dump), `.env.example`, `setup.ps1` script, example search config seed, README quick-start guide | 2026-03-17 |

## Plan 5: n8n Webhook Triggers

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Low

Add webhook trigger nodes to Scrape Listings, Scrape Detail Pages, and Cleanup Artifacts for programmatic triggering.

---

## Plan 14: Codebase Audit Bug Fixes

**Status:** Mostly complete (14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.6, 14.8 done). Remaining items are low-risk defensive fixes.

**14.1 — VIN case normalization** — `stg_detail_observations` passes raw VIN (only 1 lowercase VIN found)
**14.5 — Price events dedup** — `UNION ALL` with no dedup (only 1 actual duplicate found)
**14.9 — Browser singleton lock** — no `threading.Lock()` on `get_browser()` (low risk in practice)
**14.11 — Chrome fingerprint env var** — hardcoded `chrome131` (working fine currently)
**14.12 — max_safety_pages validator** — no bounds check (low risk)

---

## Plan 16: Pipeline Efficiency

**Status:** 16.1 + 16.2 done. 16.3 monitoring.

**16.3 — Monitor detail scrape volume (~March 20)**
- If daily detail volume stabilizes ~6-8K: no changes needed.
- If still 30K+/day: change batch query to filter on `is_full_details_stale` only.

---

## Plan 20: dbt + Postgres Health in Dashboard

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Medium

Expand Pipeline Health section with:
- **dbt:** Last build time, duration, status
- **Postgres:** Active/idle-in-transaction connections, long-running queries
- **Locks:** Blocked queries (`pg_stat_activity` + `pg_locks`)

---

## Remaining Priority Order

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | **20** — dbt + Postgres health in dashboard | Operational visibility |
| 2 | **14.1** — VIN case normalization | Defensive — only 1 affected VIN |
| 3 | **14.5** — Price events dedup | Defensive — only 1 duplicate found |
| 4 | **14.9** — Browser lock | Low risk in practice |
| 5 | **14.11** — Chrome fingerprint env var | Working fine currently |
| 6 | **14.12** — max_safety_pages validator | Low risk |
| 7 | **16.3** — Monitor detail volume | Wait until ~March 20 |
| 8 | **5** — Webhook triggers | Nice-to-have |

---

## Plan 25: Bridge Dealer ID Systems

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Low

cars.com uses two completely different dealer identifiers:
- **UUID** (`150b427b-c147-5a18-a733-cf5aa95519d0`) — in SRP JSON, stored in `srp_observations.seller_customer_id`
- **Numeric** (`735`) — in detail page HTML, stored in `dealers.customer_id`

These represent the same dealer but can never be joined directly. The `dealers` table (name, street, phone, rating) is currently an island — it can't be linked to `mart_deal_scores` or any SRP-based model.

**Fix:** Add `seller_customer_id` (UUID) column to `dealers`. Populate it during Parse Detail Pages by looking up the VIN being parsed → `srp_observations.seller_customer_id`. One backfill query covers existing data.

Once bridged: `mart_deal_scores` can join to `dealers` for phone, rating, website; dealer reputation scoring becomes possible.

---

## Future Ideas (Unprioritized)

- **Price alert notifications** — email/SMS when a VIN drops below a threshold
- **Dealer reputation scoring** — aggregate rating, inventory size, price competitiveness
- **Geographic heatmaps** — map view of inventory density and pricing by region
- **VIN decode enrichment** — NHTSA VIN decoder for specs not on Cars.com (engine, transmission, packages)
- **Historical deal analysis** — track which deal-scored VINs actually sold (went unlisted) and at what price

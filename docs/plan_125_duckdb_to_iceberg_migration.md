# Plan 125: DuckDB to Iceberg Analytics Migration

## Status

**Draft.** This plan is the next major lakehouse step after the paused Plan
112 foundation work.

Plan 112 proved that Iceberg, Lakekeeper, Spark, local snapshots, and MLflow
provenance can work in this repo. It did **not** make Iceberg the analytical
contract. Today, dbt still builds the important analytics tables into
`analytics.duckdb`, and dashboards/scripts still assume DuckDB is the serving
surface.

Plan 125 moves the project from:

```text
normalized Parquet -> dbt-duckdb -> analytics.duckdb -> dashboards/backtests
```

to:

```text
normalized Parquet/Iceberg -> Spark/dbt-compatible execution -> Iceberg tables
        -> dashboards/backtests/MLflow
```

## Goal

Make Iceberg the canonical analytics table layer and reduce DuckDB to, at most,
a local query/cache tool.

The plan should be complete when the core adaptive-refresh feature/mart chain
can be built, validated, and consumed from Iceberg without relying on
`analytics.duckdb` as the source of truth.

## Non-Goals

- No production adaptive-refresh claim integration. Plan 113 owns that.
- No catalog RBAC/governance expansion. Plan 119 owns that.
- No model training claims. Plan 112 resumes model/backtest work after this
  plan supplies stable Iceberg-native inputs.
- No full dashboard redesign unless required to read the new backend.

## Design Principles

1. **Port by chain, not by everything-at-once.**
   Start with the smallest useful feature chain and validate parity.

2. **Keep Plan 120 local snapshots as the repeatable test substrate.**
   Every migration gate should be runnable locally against the A4-style seeded
   fixture, not only on the VM.

3. **Compare before switching readers.**
   DuckDB and Iceberg outputs should run side by side until grain, row count,
   null, freshness, and sampled entity checks pass.

4. **Do not hand-roll a new modeling framework.**
   Prefer `dbt-spark` or a similarly standard dbt-compatible path if it can
   write Iceberg cleanly. Use custom PySpark only where dbt cannot reasonably
   express the operation.

5. **Treat resource limits as product requirements.**
   Spark jobs need bounded memory, explicit one-shot execution, and clear
   cleanup behavior.

## Gate 0: Portability Audit

Audit the current dbt project for DuckDB-specific assumptions.

Deliverables:

- Script or doc table listing every model with:
  - materialization
  - tags (`hourly_core`, `feature_daily`, `backtest`)
  - source dependencies
  - DuckDB-specific SQL/functions
  - incremental strategy
  - candidate migration difficulty
- Recommendation for first migration chain.

Likely first chain:

- `stg_observations`
- `stg_price_events`
- `int_listing_observation_fingerprints`
- `int_listing_observation_runs`
- `int_listing_state_fingerprints`
- `int_listing_state_runs`
- `int_price_history`
- `int_listing_volatility_features`

Open question: whether staging models should read normalized Parquet directly
through Spark or first register normalized Parquet as external Iceberg/metadata
tables.

## Gate A: Spark/dbt Execution Spike

Add the smallest dbt/Spark execution path that can materialize one model into
Iceberg.

Candidate implementation:

- Add a dedicated Spark/dbt profile target.
- Reuse `lakehouse/Dockerfile` rather than creating another runtime image.
- Point the target at Lakekeeper REST catalog + MinIO.
- Materialize one tiny fixture model into an isolated namespace/table.

Success criteria:

- Runs locally against Plan 120 seeded data.
- Runs in CI if runtime is acceptable; otherwise has unit coverage plus a
  documented VM/local smoke.
- Writes an Iceberg table with deterministic name/prefix.
- Captures table metadata: catalog, namespace, table, snapshot ID, row count,
  schema, source snapshot.

## Gate B: First Real Model Chain

Port the first useful adaptive-refresh feature chain to Iceberg.

Recommended target: `int_listing_volatility_features`, because Plan 112 already
proved it can be exported and validated as one row per `vin17`.

Required parity checks against existing DuckDB output:

- row count
- distinct primary key count
- duplicate key count
- null counts for schema-tested fields
- min/max freshness timestamps
- source distribution where relevant
- sampled VIN/listing histories
- hash or checksum comparison for stable subsets where practical

This gate should not switch dashboards yet. It proves correctness.

## Gate C: Incremental Semantics

Recreate the Plan 123 incremental behavior in the Iceberg path.

Models needing special care:

- `int_listing_observation_fingerprints`
- `int_listing_state_fingerprints`
- `int_price_history`
- `int_listing_state_runs`
- `int_listing_observation_runs`
- `mart_scrape_volume`
- `int_latest_observation`

Required checks:

- bootstrap from empty table
- idempotent rerun
- late-arrival lookback pickup
- correction replacement
- affected-entity full-history reread where required
- full-refresh equivalence

Use the shared seeded fixture phases from Plan 123/120 where possible. Avoid
reintroducing tiny throwaway dbt projects as the main coverage path.

## Gate D: Reader Migration

Move consumers off `analytics.duckdb` one by one.

Reader options to evaluate:

1. Dashboard queries read Iceberg through Spark/Thrift or another query service.
2. Dashboard queries use DuckDB only as a lightweight Iceberg reader/cache.
3. A scheduled job publishes dashboard-serving extracts from Iceberg.

The target is not "DuckDB is forbidden"; the target is "DuckDB is no longer
the authoritative build artifact."

Required consumers:

- dashboard routes/queries
- ops health/info surfaces that inspect analytics tables
- Plan 112 backtest scripts
- local rehearsal/preflight scripts

## Gate E: Cutover and Retirement

After parity and reader migration:

- Stop treating `/data/analytics/analytics.duckdb` as canonical.
- Update Airflow/dbt cadence to build Iceberg-native tables.
- Keep a rollback path for at least one release cycle:
  - last known good DuckDB build
  - last known good Iceberg snapshots
  - documented switchback command
- Update docs/PLANS.md and architecture docs to reflect the new analytical
  contract.

## Testing Strategy

Unit tests:

- SQL/rendering/config checks.
- Compose/image config checks.
- Metadata/prefix safety checks.

Integration tests:

- Local Plan 120 snapshot -> seeded MinIO -> Spark/dbt -> Iceberg chain.
- Existing seeded fixture phases for incremental scenarios.
- Parity comparison between DuckDB and Iceberg for the migration chain.

VM tests:

- Full production-scale chain build.
- Resource/OOM check.
- Runtime comparison vs DuckDB.
- Reader smoke for dashboards/backtest scripts.

## Risks

- dbt-spark SQL dialect incompatibilities.
- Spark runtime weight on the VM and in CI.
- Iceberg incremental semantics differing from DuckDB delete+insert behavior.
- Dashboard query latency if a good serving path is not chosen.
- Overbuilding catalog/governance before the analytics migration proves useful.

## Exit Criteria

- At least the adaptive-refresh feature chain is Iceberg-native.
- DuckDB and Iceberg parity passes for that chain.
- Local rehearsal can build/read the Iceberg tables from a Plan 120 snapshot.
- VM run passes without OOM.
- Plan 112 can resume Gate C using Iceberg tables as its replay input.
